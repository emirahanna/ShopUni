# ShopUni

We are four Penn State students who intend to create a comprehensive storefront application that will allow college-aged
customers to sell and purchase products independently. This is our attempt of modelling a complex system, consisting of
multiple subsystems and organized using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture.

## M05-A01 Final Project Implementation:

### Use Cases

1. View Product Details ✅
2. Add Product to Cart ✅
3. Track Order ✅
4. Purchase Order ✅
5. Authenticate Account ✅

### User Credentials for Log In

    username: buyer
    password: pwd

### Context:

The use cases we implemented are sequential (Adding a product to the cart, and purchasing a product) and both relate to
a single user, the customer. Hence, we have an extra navigation menu for the assignment, and included a small link
underneath the buttons to experience the app as we intended

### Additional Details

Note: we have yet to find images for all 50 of our sample products. Please do not be confused if you see the same
product image. That is intentional, and will be fixed by the presentation
