# ShopUni

We are four Penn State students who intend to create a comprehensive storefront application that will allow college-aged customers to sell and purchase products independently. This is our attempt of modelling a complex system, consisting of multiple subsystems and organized using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture.


## M04-A03 Two Implemented Use Cases with Clean, Refactored Code: 

### Use Cases
  1. View Product Details ✅
  2. Add Product to Cart ✅
  3. Track Order
  4. Purchase Order ✅
  5. Authenticate Account ✅

### User Credentials for Log In
    username: buyer
    password: pwd


### Context:

The use cases we implemented are sequential (Adding a product to the cart, and purchasing a product) and both relate to a single user, the customer. Hence, we have an extra navigation menu for the assignment, and included a small link underneath the buttons to experience the app as we intended
