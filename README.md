# ShopUni

We are four Penn State students who intend to create a comprehensive storefront application that will allow college-aged
customers to sell and purchase products independently. This is our attempt of modelling a complex system, consisting of
multiple subsystems and organized using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture.

## M05-A01 Final Project Implementation:

### Use Cases

1. View Product Details ✅
2. Add Product to Cart ✅
3. Track Order ✅
4. Purchase Order ✅
5. Authenticate Account ✅

### User Credentials for Log In 
You can also create your own account as well.

    username: buyer
    password: pwd

### Context:

The use cases we implemented are sequential (Adding a product to the cart, and purchasing a product) and both relate to
a single user, the customer. Hence, we have an extra navigation menu for the assignment, and included a small link
underneath the buttons to experience the app as we intended
