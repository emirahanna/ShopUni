## NOTES
- requires the method stubs and fields as well (not just classes)

for cohesion analysis diagram -> i can couple them into a single attribuet (for example payment related attributes i can compile them into a single circle for the diagram)

- no need to do diagrams for the view and controller. (controller cause no attriubtes, and then view no because we know they are all related to each other)
